# Sapphire Mine - Finance Project

## Introduction
This group project is from an Intermediate Finance course at Gonzaga University. We were assigned an investment proposal for a mine. The investor wanted to know which of the two mine designs was best and if either of them would create value (positive Net Present Value) for her over alternative investment options. Additionally, the investor wanted to know the risks associated with the mine, such as overruns and gem price variation. 

## Document descriptions 
Sapphire Mine Description: This document is a description of the project that our group was assigned. The document contains a short background of an investment proposal, along with the details of the mine and questions for our group to answer. 

Write Up: This document is where we explained our findings, answered the questions, and our suggestions to the investor. The red alerts in this document are references to the Case Work Excel sheet.

Case Work: This Excel sheet has all of the math and calculations that we used for the project. While calculations like net income and total expenses could be beneficial, we decided not to include them because the project did not ask for them and they would clutter the charts up. The red alerts in this Excel sheet are references to the Write Up document.

## Conclusion
We have summarized our work and suggestions for the investor on the last page of the Write Up document in the Summary section. 

## Future Additions
If I were to do this project again, I would have calculated the NPV break-even point. Seeing how many gems needed to be mined to produce a zero NPV would be very beneficial to the investor so she knows the minimum that she must get. This could also help them ensure that they reach their goals by basing their minimum mining rate on this number.
